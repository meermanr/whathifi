I wrote a script to scrape the technical specifications, ratings, and prices of all the Home Cinema AV Receiver reviews on [What HiFi website](http://whathifi.com) because their search feature did not provide a means to filter reviews by anything useful, such as whether it is THX certified or not, or how many speakers outputs it supports.

This is the resulting visualisation using D3js.org
