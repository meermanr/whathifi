        <h1>What HiFi AV Receiver reviews</h1>
        <p>
        I wrote a script to scrape the technical specifications, ratings, and 
        prices of all the Home Cinema AV Receiver reviews on <a 
            href='http://whathifi.com'>What HiFi website</a> because their 
        search feature did not provide a means to filter reviews by anything 
        useful, such as whether it is THX certified or not, or how many 
        speakers outputs it supports.
        </p>
        <p>
        In all, <span id='review_count'>COUNT</span> reviews have been scraped 
        into my MongoDB based database.
        </p>
        <ul id='review_names'>
        </ul>
        <p>Sample chart (used during development of the Punchcard Chart 
        code):</p>
        <p id='example'/>
        <p>Punchcard Chart of AV receiver ratings (y-axis) versus price in Â£GBP 
        (x-axis). Bubble size represent number of reviews which fall into the 
        category.</p>
